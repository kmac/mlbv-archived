mlbv - MLB stream viewer
========================

`mlbv` is a command-line interface to the MLB.tv service. It's primary purpose is to allow you to view game
streams on linux, including live streams, with a valid MLB tv subscription.  It also allows you to view game
status, results and schedules, stream highlights (recap and condensed games), and filter results based on
favourite teams.

Features:

* stream or record live or archived MLB games (requires MLB.tv subscription)
* show completed game highlights (condensed or recap) (no subscription required)
* display game schedules for given day or number of days
    - option to show or hide scores
* filter display based on favourite teams
* show standings


This project is inspired from the [streamglob](https://github.com/tonycpsu/streamglob) project, although it
differs in that it does not provide an interactive interface. It strictly command-line based, although it does
offer quite a few options to view game-related data.  This project allows you to quickly find the game,
status, or highlights of your favourite team.

Note: if you have [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed, try using the included wrapper script **`mlbv-fzf`**
([see wiki](https://github.com/kmac/mlbv/wiki/mlbv-fzf)) which provides a more interactive interface for game selection.

This package requires a valid MLB.tv subscription in order to view live or archived games. It is also subject
to local blackout restrictions. However, if you don't have a subscription you can still view game recaps or
condensed games.

````

This project incorporates some code modified from the following projects: 

* [mlbstreamer](https://github.com/tonycpsu/mlbstreamer): a similar project. 
    - Session authentication code is taken shamelessly from this project.
* [Kodi plugin.video.mlbtv](https://github.com/eracknaphobia/plugin.video.mlbtv)


## Pre-Requisites:

`mlbv` requires the following software to be installed and configured:

* python 
    - python v3 (tested with 3.7) 
* python modules (installed by `pip install`):
    - [requests](http://python-requests.org/) module 
    - [python-dateutil](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) module
    - [python-lxml](http://lxml.de/) module
* [streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/)
* a video player. Either `vlc` or `mpv` is recommended.
    - Note: player can be specified via config file. If player is not on the system path you may need to
      setup the full path in the config file.

This software is tested under linux. It should work under Windows or Mac with the pre-requisites installed,
but may require minor tweaks (bug reports are welcome).


## 1. Installation

### Via pip

This project is on the Python Package Index (Pypi) at [mlbv](https://pypi.org/project/mlbv), and can be
installed using `pip`.

1. Run `pip install mlbv`
2. Run `mlbv --init` to create a configuration directory and populate the `config` file
   with defaults and the required MLB.tv username and password. See the next section for more details.

### Archlinux

Install `mlbv` via the AUR.


## 2. Configuration

After installing, run:

    mlbv --init

This will create the initial config file/directory and populate it with the prompted MLB.tv username and password.
The `config` file will be located at `$HOME/.config/mlbv/config`. Directories are created if necessary.

Other properties in the config file are documented in the file itself. If you want to stream live or archived
games then you must provide valid login credentials (if you don't have MLB.tv you can still see scores and
watch highlights).

Some properties you may want to set in the `config` file:

* `username`: MLB.tv account username
* `password`: MLB.tv account password
* `favs`: a comma-separated list of team codes which:
    - 1) are highlighted in the game data, and 
    - 2) are used for the default filter in the `-o/--filter` option (to show only the favourite team(s))
* `scores`: a boolean specifying whether or not you want to see scores in the game information. Warning: spoilers!
* `resolution`: the stream quality (passed in to streamlink). Use '720p_alt' for full HD at 60 frames/sec.
    - options are: 'worst', '224p', '288p', '360p', '504p', '540p', '720p', '720p_alt', 'best'
* `linescore`: to enable linescores by default (if scores are enabled)


## 3. QUICKSTART

Here's a quick overview of the most common usage options:

    mlbv               # show today's schedule/scores
    mlbv -l            # show today's linescores
    mlbv -t tor        # play today's Jays game, either live (if in-progress), or from the start (if archived)
    mlbv --recaps      # play all of today's recaps
    mlbv --standings   # show current standings


Help is available by running:

    mlbv --help   # short help
    mlbv --usage  # view full documenation
 

## 4. Default Behaviour: Show Schedule/Scores

Running `mlbv` by itself shows you the status of today's games, including scores (unless you've configured to hide scores by default).

### Scores/No-Scores

The `scores` option in the config file controls whether or not scores are shown. If false then no scores are
shown. Scores are also not shown before a feed is launched.

You can temporarily override the config file using either `-s/--scores` or `-n/--no-scores` options.


### Linescores

Linescores are displayed using the `-l/--linescore` option. You can also make linescores the default in the config file.

Since linescores take up more screen real estate it can be useful to combine them with a filter to limit the number of games shown. 


### Dates and Filters

See the sections below on Dates and Filters for more information on specifying dates and filtering output based on
league, division, favourites, or arbitrary teams.


> Note on Arguments
> 
> Frequently used arguments have both a long form with double-dash `--` argument and a short form which uses a single dash `-`. 
> 
> For the long form arguments, you can shorten any option name down to the shortest unique value.  For example,
> rather than having to type `--yesterday` you can shorten it right down to `--y`.  However, you can only
> shorten `--tomorrow` down to `--to` since there is also the `--team` option (which makes `--t` non-unique).


### Show Extra Information (--info)

The --info option will show extra textual information for either the game preview or the game summary (depending on which is available).
The extra information is displayed inline, within the game info.

- Pregame: shows probable starting pitchers (when available).
- Postgame (when available): shows game summary, and full game recap article.

The default for `--info` is actually equivalent to `--info=full`. 
If you want to have a more brief set of extra information, use `--info=short` or just `--info short`.
You can also permanently set the `full/short` default for this setting via the `config` file setting:
`info_display_articles=true|false` (i.e. setting info_display_articles=false will cause `--info` to 
behave like `--info=short`).

NOTE: Since there may be a lot of text to present, this option tends to work best with the `-o/--filter` option,
which filters the display out by a team or set of teams. See the 'Filters' section for more information'


Examples:

    mlbv --info --yes     # show yesterday's games with full article info
    mlbv --info -o --yes  # show yesterday's games with full article info, filtered by favs
    mlbv --info -o tor,bos --yes  # show yesterday's games with full article info, filtered for only tor,bos

    mlbv --info=short --yes  # show yesterday's games with only summary info

    mlbv --info        # show today's games with full info (probable pitchers, with details)
    mlbv --info -o     # show today's games with full info (probable pitchers only), filtered by favs
    mlbv --info short  # show today's games with summary info (probable pitchers only)


## 5. Watching a Live or Archived Game

Watching a game is triggered by the `-t/--team TEAM` option. With this option the game stream (live or
archived) is launched for the given team. 

When passing `-t/--team TEAM` option, the stream is launched for the given team. By default the local feed
for the given team is chosen - i.e., it will follow the home/away feed appropriate for the team so that you
get the local team feed.  You can override the feed using the `-f/--feed` option. This works for either live
games or for archived games (e.g. if you use the `--date` option to select an earlier date).

Example:

    mlbv --team tor          # play the live Blue Jays game
    mlbv --yesterday -t tor  # play yesterday's Blue Jays game (see below for options on specifying dates)


### Feed Selection

By default the local feed for the given team is chosen - i.e., it will follow the home/away feed appropriate
for the given team so that you get the team's local feed if available.  You can override the feed using the
`-f/--feed` option. This works for either live games or for archived games (e.g. if you use the `--date`
option to select an earlier date).

    mlbv --team tor --feed away  # choose the away feed (assuming Toronto is the home team, you will get the
                                 # opposing team's feed)


### Specifying Stream Start Location

For an in-progress game, the stream will join the live game at the current time. Use either  `--from-start` or
the `--inning/-i` option to override this behaviour.

For an archived game, the stream will start from the beginning.


#### Start from Inning

For both live and archived games you can start from the top or bottom of an inning:

    mlbv --team tor --inning t5  # start from top of 5th
    mlbv -t tor -i t5            # same thing but with short switches
    mlbv --team tor --inning b5  # start from bottom of 5th


#### Start from Beginning (Live Game)

For a live game, you can start from the beginning with:

    mlbv --team tor --from-start  # start stream at beginning, live games only


### Doubleheaders

If a game is a doubleheader then you can select the second game using the `-g/--game` argument. 
By default it will select the first game.


## 6. Record/Fetch

If you pass the `-f/--fetch` option, instead of launching the video player, the selected stream is saved to
disk. The stream is named to convention: `<date>-<away_team>-<home_team>-<feed>.ts`.

- Live games have extension `.ts`, highlight games are `.mp4`


Example: `2018-03-31-nyy-tor-home.ts`.

If your player supports it, you can select the stream to fetch, then manually launch your video player at a
later time while the stream is being saved to file. 

Example:

    mlbv --team tor --fetch  # Fetch the live jays game to disk. 
                             # Most video players allow you to view while downloading


## 7. Highlights: Recap or Condensed Games

Playing the game highlight is triggered by using the `-f/--feed` option. The `recap` or `condensed` feeds show
up after a game has ended. To watch the highlight, specify one of those feeds along with the team name in the
`-t/--team` option.

Example:

    mlbv --team tor -f condensed
    mlbv --team tor -f recap

NOTE: You don't need login credentials to play highlights.


### Playing Multiple Game Recaps (for a given day)

The `--recaps` option lets you select a batch of game recaps to watch for a given day.
This option shows game recaps either for all games or for a selected set of teams (using a filter).
If no argument is given to `recaps` then no filter is applied.

Usage:

    --recaps ?filter?  : filter is optional, if not supplied then all games are selected

Examples:

    mlbv --recaps                       # show all available game recaps for today's games
    mlbv --yesterday --recaps           # show all available game recaps for yesterday's games
    mlbv --yesterday --recaps ale       # show available game recaps for yesterday's games
                                        # in the American League East
    mlbv --yesterday --recaps tor,wsh   # show game recaps for yesterday's Toronto, Boston games
    mlbv --yesterday --recaps tor,wsh --fetch   # same as above but save to disk instead of view


## 8. Specifying Dates

You can specify the date to view using one of the following:

    -d|--date yyyy-mm-dd    # specific date
    --yesterday (or --yes)  # shortcut to yesterday
    --tomorrow  (or --tom)  # shortcut to tomorrow

For listing game data only (doesn't make sense for viewing), you can specify a number of days using the
`--days DAYS` option. Use this to show a schedule. It's useful with the `--filter` option to filter based on
favourite team(s).


## 9. Filters

You can filter the schedule/scores displays using the `-o/--filter` argument. 
The filter argument allows you to provide either a built-in filter name or a comma-separated list of team codes.

The filter option has the form:

    -o/--filter ?filter?  : where ?filter? is optional, and is either 
                            a 'filter name' or a comma-separated list of teams

> Note: -o is used as the short form because -f is taken. mnemonic: -o -> 'only'

> Note: Aside from the `--filter` command, other command arguments accept the same 'filter' string.
>       For example `--linescore ?filter?` and `--recaps ?filter?`


### Built-in Filters

If `?filter?` is not given then the built-in filter `favs` is used. `favs` is a filter which you can define 
in the config file to list your favourite team(s).

Other built-in filters are available which group teams by league and division. The filter names are:

* `al`, `ale`, `alc`, `alw` (American League, AL East, AL Central, AL West)
* `nl`, `nle`, `nlc`, `nlw` (National League, NL East, NL Central, NL West)

Using one of the above filter names will include those selected teams in the output.


### Ad-hoc Filters

You can also use any comma-separated list of team codes for a filter.

Examples:

    --filter tor            # single team filter
    --filter tor,bos,wsh    # multiple team filter
    -o tor,bos,wsh          # same as above using shorter `-o` form

Note: Do not use spaces between commas unless you encapsulate the list in quotes.


## 10. Standings

You can display standings via the `--standings [category]` option. This option displays the given standings category then exits.

You can also specify a league or division filter via `-o/--filter`.

Standings categories:

* all
* division [default]
* conference
* wildcard
* league
* postseason
* preseason

By default, the division standings are displayed for today's date. 
You can add the `-d/--date yyyy-mm-dd` option to show standings for any given date.

You don't have to specify the full standings category, it will match any substring given. e.g. `--standings d`
will match division or `--standings wild` will match wildcard.

You can also use the `-o/--filter` option to narrow down what is displayed. e.g. `--standings division --filter ale`


## 10. Statistics

You can display statistics via the `--stats` option. This option displays the given statistics category then exits.

There are two main stats categories:
- league
- team

The stats category and further options are selected via arguments to `--stats`:

    league|<team>[:category][:qualifier]

Where the category and qualifier are used to narrow down the statistics returned.  The category is one of 'hitting', 'fielding', or
'pitching', while the qualifier differs for league and team stats. These are outlined further in their respective sections below.

By default, the league standings are displayed for today's date. 
You can also add the `-d/--date yyyy-mm-dd` option to show standings for any given date.


### Categories

Statistics are broken out into three main categories:

- hitting
- fielding
- pitching

By default, all three categories are shown. You can specify any of the above to limit the output to one of the main categories.

> You don't have to specify the full statistics category, it will match any substring given. e.g. `--stats league:h`
> is the same as `league:hitting`.


### League Statistics

The league stats show the leaders over the three main categories, for various statistic measurements.

The league `--stats` format is:

    league:[category]:[qualifier]
        [category]: one of: hitting, fielding, pitching, all [default: all]
        [qualifier]: all, qualified, rookies [default: qualified]

Filters:

League stats can be filtered by league. Valid filters are `al`, `american`, or `nl`, `national`. These are specified via the standard `-o/--filter` option.

Examples:

    mlbv --stats league                    # league stats for all categories, qualified players
    mlbv --stats league:hitting:qualified  # hitting stats, include qualified players (default)
    mlbv --stats league:hitting:rookies    # hitting stats, only rookies
    mlbv --stats league::rookies           # rookie leaders, all categories
    mlbv --stats league:hitting:all        # hitting stats, all players
    mlbv --stats league:fielding
    mlbv --stats league:pitching
    mlbv --stats league:pitching -o al     # filter by american league
    mlbv --stats league -o nl              # filter by american league


You can also include --date, to specify the season (league stats are per-season):

    mlbv --stats league --date 2010  # league stats for 2010

By default, 10 entries are given for each individual displayed statistic. You can override this via a config setting: `stats_limit`. For
example, you could add this to your config file to only show 5 entries per individual statistic:

    stats_limit=5


### Team Statistics

The second form of statistics are for a given team. Here you use the team abbreviation plus the optional category:qualifier.
The team form is

    <team>:[category]:[qualifier]
        <team>: the team abbreviation
        [category]: one of: hitting, fielding, pitching, all [default: all]
        [qualifier]: the roster type: active, full, 40man

    Examples: tor:hitting:active  # active roster only (default)
              tor:hitting:full    # full season roster
              tor:hitting:40man   # 40-man roster

> You don't have to specify the full statistics category, it will match any substring given. e.g. `--stats <team>:h`
> is the same as `<team>:hitting`.

Examples:

    mlbv --stats tor                       # Blue Jays stats for all categories, qualified players
    mlbv --stats tor:pitching              # Blue Jays pitching stats
    mlbv --stats tor::full                 # Blue Jays stats, all categories, full season roster

You can also include --date, narrowed down to a particular day (unlike league stats which are only specified for an entire season):

    mlbv --stats tor --date 2010-08-01  # Blue Jays team stats on 2010-08-01
