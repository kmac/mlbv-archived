# Bandwidth/stream resolution. This is passed into streamlink. 
# One of: 'worst', '224p', '288p', '360p', '504p', '540p', '720p', '720p_alt', 'best'
#   Note: 720p_alt is the 60fps stream; all others are 30fps.
#   Fallback streams can be specified by using a comma-separated list, e.g.: 720p_alt,720p,540p
#resolution=720p_alt

# Video player. One of vlc or mpv is recommended here. You can also set options for the player here as well.
# Example: video_player=mpv --cache 153600
#video_player=mpv
video_player=

# Audio player for audio-only feeds (not implemented yet):
#audio_player=mpv

# Use streamlink for highlights. If false will send url direct to video_player (no resolution selection)
#streamlink_highlights=true
# Passthrough the HLS stream to the player for highlights: allows seeking
#streamlink_passthrough_highlights=true

# Passthrough the HLS stream to the player for live/archived games. 
# This shouldn't be required, and it bypasses any streamlink magic done to handle the HLS stream.
#streamlink_passthrough=false

# Audio selection
# Control what audio streams are included in the output.
# You can select all (*) or provide a comma-separated list of one or some combination of:
#   English,Natural Sound,English Radio,Radio EspaÃ±ola
# Note: the main 'English' feed seems to always be included. 
# Set to blank to disable (only the main stream is included, this will save some disk space and/or bandwidth)
#streamlink_hls_audio_select=*

# Extra streamlink arguments
# If set, these arguments are appended to the streamlink arguments before sent to the player.
# This is a comma-separated list of arguments (individual arguments should be separated by a comma).
# For example to use streamlink's external http, you can set the video_player to an empty
# string, and then use the following streamlink_extra_args to have streamlink publish on port 8080. e.g:
#video_player=
#streamlink_extra_args=--player-external-http,--player-external-http-port,8080
#
# Default:
#streamlink_extra_args=

# Turn on extra debugging information
#debug=false
